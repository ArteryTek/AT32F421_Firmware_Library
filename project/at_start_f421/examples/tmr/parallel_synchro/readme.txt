  this demo is based on the at-start board, in this demo, pa6, pa2 and pa8
  output pwm waveform. the tmrxclk is fixed to 120 mhz, the tmr3 counter clock
  is 120 mhz.
  the master tmrer tmr3 is running at 375 khz and the duty cycle is equal to 20%
  the tmr3 is running:
  - at (tmr1 frequency)/ (tmr3 period + 1) = 37.5 khz and a duty cycle
  equal to tmr3_c1dt/(tmr3_pr + 1) = 30%
  the tmr15 is running:
  - at (tmr1 frequency)/ (tmr15 period + 1) = 75 khz and a duty cycle
  equal to tmr15_c1dt/(tmr15_pr + 1) = 60%

  for more detailed information. please refer to the application note document AN0085.
