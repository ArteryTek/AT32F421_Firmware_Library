  this demo is based on the at-start board, in this demo, shows how to test
  hang mode with an external trigger.

  hang mode test -----
  step1: tmr1 is configured as master timer:
  - toggle mode is used

  step2: tmr1 is configured as slave timer for an external trigger connected
  to tmr1 ch2 pin (tmr1 ch2 configured as input pin:pa9):
  - the tmr1 c2if2 is used as trigger input
  - rising edge is used to start and stop the tmr1: hang mode.

  the timxclk is fixed to 120 mhz, the prescaler is equal to 2 so the tmrx clock
  counter is equal to 40 mhz.
  tmrx frequency = tmrx clock counter/ (2*(timx_period + 1)) = 500 khz.

  set-up
  connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
  - tim1 ch1 ---> pa8
